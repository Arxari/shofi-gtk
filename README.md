### Another minimalist GTK app launcher
It servers as the continuation of my previous launcher [Shofi](https://github.com/arx/Shofi) which was written in shell and ran in the terminal.
This attempts to replicate the UI and minimalism while being faster, more customizable and GUI app.

### Controls
1. When launched you automatically enter search
2. To get out of search press the down arrow and you will start to select the apps below
3. You can move through the listed apps with the up and down arrow keys
4. To get back to the search just go to the top with the up arrow

### Customization
The CSS file is located ~/.config/shofi-gtk/style.css
By default shofi comes with a nice looking (in my opinion) theme, this has the benefit of serving as a guide on how and what to change to style it to your liking.

Hope you like it :3
